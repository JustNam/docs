2. Click on the **Schedule Test Run** button.

    The **Schedule Test Run** page appears as below.

    Fill in all the required information and click **Create**.
    
You have created a new schedule for your Test Runs.

After creating the schedule, Katalon TestOps automatically directs you to the **Test Run Types** page.

The **Test Run Types** page shows you a collection of Test Runs with the same configurations (Test Environment, Trigger, Script Repository).

> Notes:
>
> Once you have created a schedule, you can set dates for Test Runs execution by creating a Trigger. See: [Execute Test Runs by a Trigger](https://docs.katalon.com/katalon-analytics/docs/kt-scheduler.html).

## View Test Runs

Right after creating a schedule for Test Runs, you can see those Test Runs in a calendar view if you go back to the **Test Runs** page.

If you click on each Test Run in the calendar, you can see its summary.

If the Tests belongs to a Test Suite, you can also see a summary of the Test Suite here.
